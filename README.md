📦 Dockerfile: Before & After Multistage Build
This project demonstrates how using multi-stage builds in Docker can significantly improve the efficiency, size, and security of container images.

🛠️ Before: Single-stage Build (Typical Flow)
A single-stage Dockerfile might look like this:

dockerfile
Copy
Edit
FROM ubuntu

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

CMD ["python3", "calculator.py"]
❌ Drawbacks:
Final image contains both Python runtime and build tools (apt, pip, etc.).

Large image size (~1GB+) because it includes Ubuntu base, package manager, caches, and everything needed during the build process.

Not secure or clean: more tools = larger attack surface.

✅ After: Multistage Build (Optimized Flow)
dockerfile
Copy
Edit
# ---------- Stage 1: Builder ----------
FROM ubuntu AS build

RUN apt-get update &&\
    apt-get install -y \
        python3 \
        python3-pip

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

# ---------- Stage 2: Final Runtime ----------
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app /app

CMD ["python3", "calculator.py"]
🚀 Benefits of Multistage Build

Feature	Single-Stage	Multi-Stage
🧹 Clean final image	❌ No	✅ Yes
📦 Final image size	❌ ~1GB+	✅ ~120MB
🛡️ Security	❌ Large attack surface	✅ Smaller, minimal base
⚙️ Separation of concerns	❌ Mixed build/runtime	✅ Isolated build & runtime
📤 Deployment speed	❌ Slower due to size	✅ Faster uploads/pulls
📂 File Structure in Final Image
Only what's needed is included in the final container:

bash
Copy
Edit
/app/
└── calculator.py
No apt, no pip, no unnecessary tools.

🧠 Summary
Using multi-stage builds helps:

Minimize image size

Improve security

Speed up build & deploy times

Keep build & runtime logic separate

It's the best practice for containerizing Python applications—especially when your build tools aren’t needed at runtime.
